<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">In juvenile days when life was new,<br>
A world of joy full of curiosity to view.<br>
A world full of gears and circuits so bright,<br>
Wish to see steel and silicon ignite.</p>


<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">With every twist and turn of screw,<br>
My passion for machines grew.<br>
Their logic and precision so true,<br>
Gave me satisfaction like a finely crafted cue.</p>


<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Your pulsing circuits and glowing screens.<br>
Illuminate the pathways of my dreams.<br>
In the dynamic rhythm of the robotic flow,<br>
A technical saga where innovation continues to grow.</p>


<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Humming of motors in my ear,<br>
LED&#39;s dancing in a digital cheer.<br>
As servos stretch and bend,<br>
My love for robots is never gonna endâ€¦</p>
