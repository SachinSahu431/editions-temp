desc: "Ending with the age old truth about the eternality of nature, the poem
  makes us appreciate the parallels created between the corresponding life
  cycles. As the winning entry at the Intra IIT culturals, hop aboard as it
  takes you through the intertwined journey of man and the seasons of nature. "

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Everything begins with a tiny speed,<br>
We call this season spring,<br>
Life on Earth is brought to speed,<br>
May it be plant or human being,<br>
The meadows all turn lush green,<br>
The daisies and buttercups grow,<br>
The birds chirp and the bears are seen,<br>
The beginning of life they show.</p>
