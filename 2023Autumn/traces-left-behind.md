<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">With no shortcuts to any places<br>Letting nature choose mine cycle's traces<br>From destining my course through many villages<br>Something strengthened me to touch higher edges<br>You gave me courage<br>to track down woody mazes</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">My legs shivered, mine heart was pounding<br>Hey, the dopamine was way too exciting<br>Me soaking shirt you serine solace<br>My brimming emotions all relaxed</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Rush, rush, the time comes short<br>Oh my friend, what about reaching home<br>Waving away this sacred space<br>Sprinting towards ending this phase</p>
