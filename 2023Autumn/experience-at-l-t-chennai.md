I did my internship at Larsen & Toubro, Chennai. I was initially allocated to Chennai Metro Rail Limited, RT01/CP08/EV01 Project, Perungudi. I got this internship through my professor, Dr. Prasanna Kumar Behera. I am grateful to him for bringing this opportunity.

RT01/CP08/EV01 Project is an EPC project where the detail details will be given from client, CMRL and L&T is responsible for execution of the project. The scope of this project is construction of elevated viaduct of metro rail. I was initially based in Planning Department which estimates the budget of each activity and keeps an eye on the progress of the work which is measured in terms of monetary costs. For the smooth progress of the project, one must plan accordingly for various activities and hand over it to the client within the stipulated time, so that the company does not face any liquidity damages.
While I was working at L&T, I estimated the quantity of reinforcement and concrete required for the pile, pile cap, pier and pier protection. Bar Bending Schedule, BBS is very important for estimating the cost, which gives the detailed information about the reinforcement. It gives the information to the workers at the job site to know about lap length, number bends, etc.

The estimated amount of reinforcement is cross verified with the BBS from the job site to know about the work progress. It helps the Quality Control Department to check whether the reinforcement work is done as per the design drawing.

Primavera software is a tool used for scheduling, sequencing, and know the work progress of the project. It helps to make sure that the resources are utilised effectively and efficiently. By using this software, I analysed the work progress for Section 6 of RT01. I was not only at planning department and but also placed Safety Department and Quality Control Department.
It was a great opportunity for me to do my internship in an ongoing project. It was wonderful experience for me to get to know where the academic knowledge is put use.

Good Luck ðŸ˜Š
