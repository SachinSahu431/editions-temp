During the summer of my second year, I embarked on an adventure that would shape my career and leave an indelible mark on my professional journey. Landing an internship at Amazon, a tech giant renowned for its innovation and global impact, was a dream come true. I applied to this internship through the Amazon Future Engineer Program which has guided me and given me practice through Bootcamps since my first year. I got shortlisted by my profile and passed an online coding test. My offer letter came within ten days of my resume’s screening.

**THE ONBOARDING:**
The excitement of embarking on a new chapter in my career had started. I prepared to take flight to the heart of India's tech hub, Bengaluru. Prior to my departure, I received an email detailing the flight arrangements and travel itinerary from Amazon. I had a warm welcome from my fellowmen at Amazon on Day 1. It is still a surprise thinking about my first Day there. One of the most exhilarating aspects of my internship was the opportunity to work on projects that had a real impact on Amazon's operations. The projects were carefully curated to align with my skills and interests, allowing me to contribute meaningfully while also pushing my boundaries. My project was CMT-Multi GL approval. I worked in a team called CMT-ASIN Importer, which expanded to the Competitor Monitoring team- Amazon Standard Identification Number Importer. The team principle, as the name explains, is competitive monitoring. I worked in the User Interface Development in Amazon Web Services which was Interface Development in Amazon Web Services which was my key project during the internship. I was given tasks such as Software Assurance Service risk-solving where the aim is to fix the pipelines when a particular pipeline fails execution.

And also the monitoring of the OE Homepage alarm monitoring, where the task is to fix the alarm threshold to initiate warning of any failures. Amazon's commitment to mentorship stood out throughout my internship. I was assigned a mentor who guided me not only through the technical aspects of my projects but also the nuances of working in a fast-paced, dynamic environment. Regular one-on-one meetings allowed me to seek guidance, ask questions, and gain insights. Amazon's work culture serves as an inspiration. The emphasis
on delivering quality work on time. We interns were expected to document the work done on a weekly basis and create a final report at the end of the internship.

**COOLEST WORKSPACE:**
From the moment you step into an Amazon office, you're greeted with an atmosphere that deviates from the conventional. The open workspaces, vibrant decor, and relaxed environment set the stage for an experience that prioritizes comfort and self-expression. Flexibility in work hours and the option to work remotely were the hallmarks of the cool and chill Amazon work experience. I swear, the aesthetics of the workspace still pleases my heart. Futuristic elements, contemporary furniture, and cutting-edge technology are seamlessly integrated to support the company's commitment to pushing boundaries.

**FUN STUFF:**
I had never stepped out of home on my own without parental monitoring since my childhood. Being given a mission to live in a fast-paced metropolitan city like Bengaluru all alone was overwhelmingly an adventure to face at 19. I managed to explore and use the exposure in the right way though. The Bengaluru living experience actually taught me the right kind of street-smartness.

Once in a while, we had heartwarming team lunches from Amazon at fancy places in Bengaluru and also had a very vibrant last-day farewell in Play Arena where we went bowling. Amazon carnivals transformed the workspace into a festival of fun and the many compliments lit up the workday.

In conclusion, Amazon's work experience is a dream for every aspiring software engineer. I considered that as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and never failed to feel amazed by my workspace. I don’t know where I see myself 5 years down the line, but these 2 months will serve as my memories to recall, no matter where I go and what I reach in life.
