<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Youngsters from across the country<br>From backgrounds different too<br>Different language each one speaks<br>But all I see is you</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Your eyes, twin galaxies of endless depth<br>Hold secrets and stories untold<br>A mystical pool where emotions ebb<br>With each glance, an adventure unfolds</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Your laughter, like a melody divine<br>Rings within the chambers of my soul<br>Its rhythm, like the symphony of time<br>Enchants my heart, making it whole</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">My admiration blooms and grows<br>Though silent like a fox in the forest<br>A silent witness to her mystery<br>A love that in my heart shall rest</p>
