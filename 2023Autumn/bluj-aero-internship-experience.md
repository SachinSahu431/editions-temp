### Application Process

For most of us, the application and shortlisting process was the same. It was high time in March when most of the core students were looking for exciting internship opportunities to knock on their doors. Thanks to Dr. Subbareddy Daggumati for inviting this company to our institute. A Google form was shared where students were asked to fill in their basic details like mobile number, roll number, resume, and other formal details. Most of our seniors told us that many of the core companies select students for internships based on resumes. So, we ensured our resumes were attractive. But to our surprise, on a Tuesday morning (which was a holiday), we received an email letting us know that we were shortlisted and the interview timings would be informed in due time. Chemical and Mechanical students had their interviews on the same day. On the following day, it was the Electrical and Civil studentsâ€™ turn. After 5 days, the final shortlist was out, and we made it. YAY!!!!!

Sai Charan had a different approach altogether. Let's listen â€¦oopsie :)â€¦. read it in his words.

"Before entering the doors of BluJ Aerospace, some uncertainties cast doubt on the availability of core internships for mechanical branch students. Sriram sir, our guide, was candid about the scarcity of paid internships and the bleak prospect of post-internship job offers. A glimmer of hope arrived when CMTI, a core internship opportunity, emerged. Out of 45 mechanical students, 26 of us applied and secured the opportunity at CMTI. However, the excitement was short-lived as we realised that accommodation was not provided, posing a major challenge. Despite the obstacles, we pressed on, determined to learn from the experience. Later, there was a silver lining as CMTI approved accommodation for students, easing the challenges we initially faced. But they did go back on their word eventually. ðŸ˜…

Dr. Subba Reddy, a member of BluJ's design team and a source of inspiration for many, came forward with an unexpected opportunity. He extended internships not only to mechanical students but also to those from civil, chemical, and electrical departments. Having taken his "Composite Materials" course, I saw his dedication and decided to take a chance. The decision turned out to be transformative as I secured an off-campus internship with Bluj Aerospace after a fruitful interview."

### Pre-Internship setup:

One week prior to our reporting, an online meeting was held where both the founders and Subbareddy sir addressed us. Each of us was instructed to install some software that we would be using over the course of time. For most of us, it was more or less our first time in Hyderabad. We were looking for some affordable and clean PGs on any and every website available online. The founders of the company came to our rescue at this crucial moment. They took care of all the logistics, which included accommodation and transport from the PG to the company. With that being done, all we had to do was pack our bags and reach Hyderabad. Utham Kumar, one of the founders of BluJ, paid a visit to our PG. He gave us a small pep talk over a cup of tea. All these gestures by the founders eased our entry into the workspace. Slowly, the anxiety turned into excitement.

### Projects Worked On

**SWATHI**: "I worked under the guidance of Utham. My work was to perform stress analysis on the control model of the aircraft prototype and to determine the structural stability of the model. In layman's terminology, I had to check for the failure of the connections and decide on cross-sections of various parts used in the model. For this, we performed 1D and 2D Finite Element Analysis on the model and derived the conclusions from the results obtained.

For this, we performed 1D FEA initially by considering the CG shift effect. Based on these results, the cross-sections of a few beams were decided. For this, we had to look up to the options available for us in the market. Later on, 2D analysis was performed by considering CG shift and propeller failure as well. The whole process enhanced my critical thinking skills. We even procured the parts, which we finalised after running n number of analyses.

Finite Element Analysis was an alien topic for me. Utham sir was kind enough to understand my plight. He gave me enough time and resources to learn the topic. We used Patran and MSc Nastran software to accomplish the tasks. The whole internship was a great learning opportunity for me. I was fascinated by the miracles a person can perform by learning the Finite Element Method and Finite Element Analysis. This fascination motivated me to learn about the subject in depth post-internship as well. "

**KANISHK**: "I was responsible for developing a linear testing setup for Type-4 hydrogen tanks as well as building a prediction model for hydrogen permeation through the tank liner. I was delighted to have Maruthi Amardeep Sri Vatsavaya, one of the company's co-founders, as my mentor. BLUJ Aerospace focuses on hydrogen-powered vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, which requires an efficient hydrogen storage solution. Type-4 tanks, designed for their lightweight and corrosion-resistant properties, can handle pressures of up to 700 bar. Hydrogen, recognized for its high energy density and minimal carbon emissions, is also the lightest and smallest element, making storage a unique problem, particularly in VTOLs that require lightweight solutions.

The Type-4 tank components consist of an impact-resistant dome, valve, polymer liner, carbon-reinforced shell, and an external protective shell. The polymer liner acts as an important barrier against gas permeation. My liner testing setup tried to measure the hydrogen gas moving through the liner sample, helping in material selection and determining liner thickness. We used the rotomolding procedure with HDPE, LDPE, and LLDPE materials. Hydrogen typically enters polymers via diffusion, absorption, and desorption processes that are influenced by temperature, pressure, crystallinity, molecular chain, and additives.

To predict permeation, we studied TDA and HPHP testing methods, as well as theoretical precision models, in our attempt to build a prediction model. However, none of them produced satisfactory outcomes. As a result, we attempted to develop our own predictive model, taking into account key factors such as pressure difference, polymer area, permeability coefficient, gas exposure time frame, and sample thickness. O-rings, sample polymer liners, valves, steel mesh, a hydrogen gas tank, bolts, pipes, and either water displacement or gas chromatography equipment were all part of the testing setup. In PowerPoint, I effectively designed the testing setup flow sheet, and in AutoCAD, I generated detailed models. I used MS Excel to perform the essential calculations for the predictive model. I had regular discussions with my mentor and team members, during which we analysed my work and highlighted flaws, allowing me to constantly improve and refine my contributionsâ€”a vital factor in the development of hydrogen tanks."

**SRIHITHA**: " BluJ's current flagship project involves the creation of a prototype aircraft, driven solely by batteries, to demonstrate vertical take-off, hover, and landing capabilities on a full-scale aircraft. A crucial aspect of this pioneering endeavour was the development of a battery pack tailored to the prototype's mission requirements. The first version of the battery pack had already been produced and tested. However, this was only the beginning. The test data, coupled with insights into the battery and propulsion systems, prompted the need for further adjustments to the overall system sizing.

My role as an intern was to contribute to this ambitious undertaking by creating a MATLAB/Simulink model for sizing the battery packs specifically for the prototype aircraft. This model would be integral in ensuring the battery packs met the unique demands of the mission.

Simulating a battery pack for an aerospace project involves considering a plethora of factors. These include the circuit connection, voltage drop across the busbars, temperature changes in the cells and the pack, thermal conductivity of the busbars, and heat transfer through convection. The battery pack, in this case, was simulated using a combination of MATLAB, Simulink, and Simscape, an intricate process that demanded careful attention to detail.

The configuration of a battery pack is not a one-size-fits-all endeavour. The number of cells in series is determined by the required pack voltage, while the number of cells in parallel is dictated by the pack capacity. This level of customisation ensures that the battery pack aligns perfectly with the mission's unique demands, optimising its performance and safety.

The project was a thrilling blend of theory and practice, offering insights into the complexities of *electrical systems in aerospace technologies."*

**SAI CHARAN**: "My journey was one of learning, adaptability, and embracing opportunities. My primary task revolved around the design of the eVTOL's frame, a critical component in ensuring structural integrity and safety using ABAQUS software. The initial phase of this endeavour took around two weeks to complete. However, being part of a startup meant that changes and refinements were part of the process, leading to several delays. This experience was an eye-opener, revealing the dynamic and agile nature of startup operations.

Leveraging my knowledge from the "Composite Materials" course, I dove headfirst into the complexities of composite materials used in the frame's construction. The course equipped me with valuable insights into the behaviour of these materials, and I could apply this knowledge directly to my internship. Additionally, concepts from the "Design of Machine Elements" course played a crucial role in the bolt design process for the frame.

Apart from frame design, I also had the opportunity to work on Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for a Hydrogen Storage tank. This project, spearheaded by my fellow intern Kanishk, presented a unique set of challenges and learning opportunities. It allowed me to expand my FEA skills and gain a more holistic understanding of structural analysis.

Each day brought new insights, technical challenges, and the satisfaction of contributing to a cutting-edge technology that could revolutionise transportation. The journey was marked not only by the acquisition of technical skills but also by the invaluable experience of being part of a team dedicated to a transformative vision."

**DHANESH**: "I worked under the guidance of Utham Kumar, CTO of Bluj Aero. Though I am a student with a background in Mechanical Engineering, the work that I did was a mix of coding and solving engineering mechanics problem. I worked on creating a genetic algorithm for estimating the propeller forces for an eVTOL aircraft in hovering conditions using C++. It included different criteria like shift in the centre of mass of aircraft, failure in one of the propellers, and a combination of both. Along with this, Kanish and I developed the official website of Bluj. Throughout the process, both Utham and Amar sir provided their valuable inputs, which made the workflow pretty simple for me."

The evident fact from all this is that whatever tasks we were asked to perform, small or big, everything contributed to the final output. To be simple, not even a single task that we performed as a part of our internship was a waste of time or energy.

### 'THE' Question

The question that most of us interns encountered post-internship was, "*How was it working under Subbareddy sir?*". Though most of us had little to no work under him, his insights during the presentation that we gave at the company post-internship were very insightful. His commitment to shaping the future of the company was unwavering. Both the founders and Subbareddy sir shared a great comradery, which used to brighten the workspace. Their jokes to reduce the work stress and make everyone feel involved were very witty and highly intellectual a few times.

Here is what Sai Charan has to answer this question, as he was the one who worked under him directly.

"Working under the guidance of Dr. Subba Reddy was an inspiring and transformative experience. His unwavering commitment to excellence pushed me to exceed my own limits. What truly stood out was my unceasing interest in the work; I was so engrossed in it that I willingly extended my learning hours, often heading to the office, even on weekends. Dr Subba Reddy, not only my guide but also the Placement Officer at IIT Tirupati, provided invaluable insights into my career prospects. His guidance on ABAQUS, emphasising the need to acquire higher-end coding skills and take advanced FEM courses, opened new doors of opportunity. He encouraged me to present my work effectively, fostering my communication and presentation skills. I made daily presentations using PowerPoint slides, ensuring that I could articulate my progress clearly. What made this experience even more enriching was Dr Subba Reddy's presence at IIT Tirupati during that period. Our frequent and lengthy online discussions allowed me to fine-tune my work continuously. Sometimes, I would have a morning meeting, make substantial progress during the day, and present my findings again in the afternoon. This dynamic interaction and feedback loop ensured that the work progressed at an astonishing pace, a testament to the power of effective guidance and collaboration. Under his mentorship, I felt a sense of purpose, knowing that the work I was engaged in was innovative and had real-world relevance. On a personal level, he played the role of a counsellor, caring about my work-life balance.
