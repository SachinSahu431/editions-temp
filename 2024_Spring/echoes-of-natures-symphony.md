<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">The Very Morning,<br>
The birds chirping in the eaves,<br>
Is the loveliest cadence to bring out our essence<br>
The orange-colored circle that shows up from hills,<br>
Is the ones which alongside us for the whole day<br>
The climate of the campus,<br>
Is so capricious that it is invincible for any<br>
When the weather gets angry,<br>
Throws away anything it strokes<br>
The Heaven touching mountains,<br>
Is calling us to reach its top<br>
Those milky and pure clouds,<br>
Are erratic when they show off their emotions<br>
The mesmerizing campus ponds duo,<br>
Is filled up with love of the alma mater<br>
When the monsoon cries,<br>
Sky portrays mercy for it by varying tones<br>
The magic that makes the clouds walk,<br>
Do Grab every pictaker's attention<br>
The soothing effect of the calm wind,<br>
Make us asleep acting like a destresser<br>
The white colored circle that hides behind heaven,<br>
Is the ones which abides by us for the lonely night....</p>
