The institute's 4th and 5th joint convocation took place offline on February 22nd, 2024, marking a significant event after a three-year hiatus. This ceremony, an essential component of the institution's academic calendar, saw students receiving their degrees upon successful completion of their respective courses. Distinguished guests, including Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Hon’ble Minister of Education and Minister of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, Government of India, Shri Sajjan Jindal, Chairman of the Board of Governors (BoG) at IIT Tirupati, and Prof K. N. Satyanarayana, Director of IIT Tirupati, graced the occasion. Our team, Udaan, delves into the highlights of this convocation to offer a closer look into its proceedings.

Organizing a convocation entails a rigorous process that involves extensive collaboration among faculty, staff, and students. To streamline the process and address various aspects effectively, twelve committees were formed for the 4th and 5th joint convocation. Each committee, chaired by a faculty or staff member with an advisor and a designated number of members, was responsible for specific tasks, aided by student volunteers.

The committees for the convocation included:

1. Programme Committee
2. Reception Committee
3. Works Committee
4. Hospitality Committee
5. Finance Committee
6. Design Committee
7. Committee for Security Arrangements
8. Volunteers Committee
9. PA System & Video Coverage Committee
10. Costing Committee
11. Degree Preparation Committee
12. Steering Committee

While the number of committees may seem extensive, it reflects the comprehensive nature of the work involved in ensuring the convocation's success. Now, let's delve into the event log of the convocation day.

The convocation schedule undergoes meticulous planning to ensure smooth proceedings. A rehearsal convocation is conducted beforehand to familiarize graduands with the process, ensuring efficiency. Each graduate's interaction on stage, from approaching the dais to receiving their degree and departing, is timed to last no more than 8 seconds.

Here's a breakdown of the event log for the 4th & 5th convocation:

**February 21st:**

* 7:30 pm: Convocation dinner for graduands, faculty, and student volunteers.

**February 22nd:**

### What was your overall experience of the 4th and 5th joint convocation that was held on February 22nd?

> “Despite criticisms from many of my peers, I actually liked the convocation! Having graduated one and a half years ago, I'm now at a stage where I would appreciate every additional thing the institute does beyond providing me with a "degree.pdf". Or at least, that's what I thought until I came to the campus on the 22nd. The timid mattresses we were provided and the unpalatable mess food we purchased reminded me, yet again, that the institute strives to teach you humility before you step into the outside world. All the jokes apart, I liked the overall experience. The convocation gave me a good excuse to meet so many friends, especially those who haven't graduated yet!”
>
> “It is filled with a mix of emotions. There's a sense of accomplishment as we walk across the stage to receive the certificate. The cheers and applause from loved ones in the audience further validate this achievement, creating a sense of joy and fulfilment. At the same time, there's a bittersweet feeling as we bid farewell to this whole matter and the familiar faces of friends and professors who have been part of this journey. The realisation that this chapter of this life is ending brings a tinge of sadness. As we reflect on this time at the university, memories of laughter, late-night study sessions, and meaningful conversations flood back, evoking a sense of nostalgia. Despite the challenges and obstacles faced along the way, we always feel grateful for the experiences and lessons learned, knowing that we have grown and evolved during our time on campus.”
>
> “I was unable to attend the convocation as I am currently pursuing my Masters abroad, and it was not possible to travel to India on such short notice in the middle of my semester. However, when we received an email about allowing parents to collect my degree and Awards, it was decided that my father would attend the convocation. It was a very proud moment for my entire family, particularly my father, who collected my awards on stage. Seeing my parents and other family members so happy while they watched the livestream religiously made my day!”
>
> “My convocation experience was bittersweet. While it was fulfilling to finally receive recognition for my four years of hard work, the long wait for the ceremony and its weekday scheduling with two weeks of notice made it less accessible for many, dampening the enthusiasm. Despite these issues, a highlight was the director's personal gesture of leading an early morning campus tour, which added a touch of warmth to the formal proceedings.”
>
> “It was like a reunion for me as I have not met my batchmates since I came out of college. I could re-live my college days, staying at the hostel and enjoying the long, windy nights with my friends. I was also fortunate enough to get a mini-treat from my professors after the convocation, and my parents also interacted with my friends. Overall, it was a very enriching experience.”
>
> The joint convocation was a fantastic experience from start to finish. Everything ran smoothly and in a timely manner, thanks to the dedicated volunteers who ensured the seamless flow of the event. From welcoming students and parents to efficiently managing each student's entry onto the stage, it was a well-coordinated and memorable occasion.
>
> “It was great. I really enjoyed all the events, and it felt like a happy reunion with all my batchmates. Thanks to all the volunteers who worked hard to make sure we had a great and wonderful convocation.”
>
> "I had a great experience. The best part and the major part of the reason (apart from the degree) that I went to the convocation was to meet all my friends. It has been really long since we have seen each other and to be honest, it is very hard to be in constant touch with each and every one of our batch. It was really great catching up on the moments and memories we had. 
>
> Additionally, I got to see the new campus, which is too big now. It has changed a lot, it was kind of emotional as well, seeing those hostels where we had a lot of happy memories, and now we are kind of guests in those places."
>
> “Too hot”\
> *`<We resonate with you, my friend.>`*

### How does it feel to be coming back to the campus again? Especially the 2022 graduates?

> “Returning to campus for convocation, especially the south campus where I spent four transformative years, truly felt like coming home. Each nook and cranny brought back a flood of memories and nostalgia, reigniting a longing for what were undoubtedly the most carefree days of my life with the best people. The new north campus is breathtaking; its beauty and grandeur befitting an IIT! It was a bittersweet realisation, however, that my time to explore and enjoy the campus, new and old, was limited. The midweek scheduling of the convocation and the administration's decision to provide lodging only for Thursday meant that my desire to spend more time there remained unfulfilled.”
>
> “The campus is HUGE! I came to the campus last year, so it wasn't as surprising to me as it probably would have been. This time, however, it was more confusing than it was surprising. I knew of only one IITT campus and initially couldn't understand a thing when someone referred to 'North' or 'South' campus. The infrastructure is too good, and the facilities too! I looked at some computing facilities in the EE dept building and was fascinated by how much better it was (I'm comparing it to IIT Bombay). And you folks have pretty lakes! Maybe the campus can do with a few more trees and a little more shade, but that's about it. Enjoy your time on campus while it lasts, folks!”
>
> “Coming back to the campus again feels surreal, especially for the students who graduated in 2022 when the north campus was still under construction. The campus looks familiar, yet there's a sense of novelty with all the new additions. It's hard to believe it's been two years since we left, as it feels like just yesterday. Walking through the campus and reminiscing about every moment spent there is incredibly nostalgic and heartwarming. Being back on campus evokes a flood of memories from the past, filling us with happiness and a sense of nostalgia that's hard to put into words.”
>
> “It was a mix of calm, curiosity and awe. It felt like a home I could always come back to. Especially seeing how things have grown to be, be it building, labs, projects or initiatives, we can proudly say it carries our fingerprints. It might be in some corner- unknown, unseen, but still, it stays forever. There was a time when we used to take each and every aspect of this campus seriously and think we could change it for the better, but now we just smile and move on because there are better minds who have time now to tackle them, in their own way.”
>
> “I was amazed by the campus's growth, especially the North campus. The academic buildings and facilities are magnificently manifold compared to what we experienced as students in transit and on a temporary campus combined. So it's heartwarming to see the growth of the campus and the facilities the students can witness now. It will help them excel in their career and grow academically in their field.”
>
> “Well, it was exciting and nostalgic as we all were very much waiting for it to happen. Seeing the campus and all the familiar faces once again gave us a good boost. The new campus walk with the director in the morning hours was cherishing.”

### If you could change only one thing about how the current convocation was organised, what would that be?

The graduates have pointed out a variety of issues which we have consolidated and summarised in the following list,

* The dates could have been announced well in advance! The convocation date should be released along with the academic calendar, keeping in mind that most students move to different parts of the world and have work/academic commitments after graduating. It will never be possible to make it convenient for everyone, but trying to make it convenient for most students to attend seems sensible. 
* Reconsideration of not announcing the names of absent students or giving their degrees to representatives in a separate ceremony. This approach felt exclusionary, diminishing the achievements of those unable to attend, mainly because of the delay and short notice on which the event was held. Acknowledging every graduate's effort and success, whether present or not, would have enhanced the celebratory essence of the event, honouring the collective accomplishments of all graduates more effectively.
* Many students in both batches couldn't attend the convocation for various reasons. These students eagerly watched the live stream of the convocation in hopes of hearing their names during the degree awarding ceremony. But their names were not announced. The reason given was that there was a 3-hour time constraint for completing the convocation due to the chief guest's schedule. However, the chief guest didn't show up. There was no reason not to announce the names of those who weren't present there. They should have announced these names.
* The students were called on the stage to collect the degree very quickly. The names of 2-3 students were announced at the same time when the first one was collecting his/her degree. I know there were a lot of students, but from the students' perspective, it was bad that they didn't get enough time to enjoy that moment. When it is seen on YouTube, it seems that the student is going on the wrong name call. 
* It would have been much better if the institute had organised the convocation on a weekend.
* The decision to hold the convocation dinner on a different day missed an opportunity for a meaningful reunion with faculty and peers.
* The convocation dinner - now in terms of taste and quality
* Hospitality can be improved a bit to accommodate students and their parents
* All the accommodations and guidelines could have been planned much better.
* “It was perfect for the given circumstance; having a complaint would spoil the experience I gained.” - *an optimistic view* 
* A proper meetups with departments, clubs, and faculties
* Having a building for convocation and not a poorly ventilated tent
* Chief Guest could have come to the campus 
* Not making the convocation 1.99 years late

We sincerely hope that the organizers will take these points into consideration to ensure that future convocations are conducted in an even more exemplary manner.

### What would that be if you were to express convocation, and what would it feel like to be graduated in a single line?

As graduates traverse the threshold of academia into the realms of the unknown, their reflections on this pivotal milestone are as diverse as the paths they've trodden. Here, in a chorus of voices, they share their sentiments:

* “Graduating felt like a bittersweet symphony of pride, nostalgia, and unfulfilled yearnings amidst the backdrop of both familiar and newly unveiled campus landscapes.”
* “It gives you joy and sorrow at the same time...joy because everyone is proud of you and sorrow because u are done with one phase of ur life..”
* “It feels like nothing because we receive our certificate nearly seven months after graduation. It feels more like a reunion.”
* “You might get more vibrant answers from other people, but for me personally, the feeling of having graduated has long left me. It's been two years already. I couldn't stand graduating, so I decided to get back to studying once again! :')”
* “End of a beautiful journey filled with struggles, friendships, and unforgettable memories, paving the way for new beginnings.”
* “Good to meet friends and professors; hard to accept that we will not meet each other in a while.”
* “It was CUTE to get a degree, which not only has grades but also memories.”
* “Want to continue as a student till the end of my life”
* “4 years of college life framed into one certificate.”
* “Bittersweet to see my friends one last time.”
* “Final chance to feel like a student again.”
* “A rekindling of the fire in you!”
* “A hard-earned milestone indeed!”
* “Relieved and proud of myself.”
* “Refreshing and enthusiastic”
* “Grateful and proud"
