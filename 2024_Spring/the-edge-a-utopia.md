<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Real world or virtual world, either works for me<br>
But maybe I look happier, when I&#39;m on a gaming spree<br>
An obscured world it is, where the rules for all are same<br>
You can stampede, build or raze, its an absolute mayhem</p>


<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">The real world is a beauty, life is great here too<br>
A family that cares for you, teaches you a thing or two<br>
A sibling, old or young, is either a trainer or a trainee<br>
Even if you&#39;re a loner, pampered you&#39;ll be by many</p>


<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">In all its different colours, it&#39;ll soon show its true intention<br>
Despite being true to yourself, you&#39;ll often end up in detention<br>
Your own kingdom then you can build, retreat to your abode<br>
You can decide what happens here, its either peace or rage mode</p>


<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">I live in no man&#39;s land; I am a citizen of &quot;THE EDGE&quot;<br>
My own creation, a utopia, there&#39;s no preamble or pledge<br>
I can peek into both the worlds, go wherever I am wanted<br>
I can always cross the border, when the real world feels haunted.</p>
