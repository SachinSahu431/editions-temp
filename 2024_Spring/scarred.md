***I can hear my heart beating.***

With the pressed tuxedo suit and the swaying coconut trees, the air was filled with grief and solemnity. The hymns of crickets on the trees brimmed the air, with people all entering the church for the funeral. The sunlight filtered in through the forest backdrop, giving a warm and comforting essence to the air. The whispers of Julie's family, the prayers, and the mourning blended together so seamlessly that my heartache showed no signs of abating. I stood beside the oak tree, this time with only the two of us, sharing this moment together.

***Flashback: 7 years ago, 2017***

“You have the patient, doc.”

“Sure, send them in.”

Curly hair, maybe around 5 foot 5, eyes shining like glitters, familiar dimples. A man walked along with her, holding her hand. His eyes dimmed down; he stared helplessly at me deep into my pupils.

“Hey, the nerdy Alex from school, aren’t you? Look how big you have become! In my wildest dreams, I would have never imagined that you were the Dr. Alex of the Neurology ward! You remember me, don’t you?” She gleamed at me with those eyelids as the album of memories crawled through my heart.

**THREADS OF THE PAST**

She was Julie Pauly, a character with a chapter published in my life; her story began back in high school. To put things in short, let me summarise. I was her senior back in school, and she had a huge thing for me. Starting from the secret stares I felt standing in the canteen queue to her filmy expressions when she walked past me through the corridors, it would be fair enough for me to say that I  found myself falling for each of her gimmicks, but the timing sucked. The subtle smiles and gazes developed into casual greetings, which then blossomed into what I'd call 'chit-chats'.

Ahem.

The chit-chats were suppressed easily. You know, it is so easy to shield something between a senior and a junior- all you have to say is, “ I’m mentoring her!”.

Yeah, so I was apparently mentoring her. Though I felt I was genuinely into this ‘mentoring’ mentoring business, she felt otherwise. Her intentions seemed questionable, and I was wary of her advances. The memories of the hour-long chats under the oak tree in the Church next to our school after the last period still blooms in my mind. The three of us had become partners in crime, and those were the small moments that made my school life colourful.

But I didn’t want to take our relationship any further than friendship. Not that she was a red flag, or a red carpet, as my Gen Z Instagram-addicted kids say, but rather the fact that I would be moving to the US the following year to continue my studies in medicine. I didn’t want to give her false hope as nothing was meant to be; it wouldn’t last. 

But she couldn’t contain her excitement, it seemed.  Two weeks before my prelims, she asked me to meet her near our church. the place that ignited the flame of all my memories. I remember it vividly,, under the oak tree, where she handed me a letter - the old school type, a poem. Perhaps too much to expect, I cursed myself for it. The poem wasn’t expertly woven, but it was enough to flatter and butter me up.

And where did it bring me? What did I do? I did something you’d probably beat me up for - I avoided her. I did what I had to do to avoid breaking her heart.

Immaturity versus maturity in action, I was recast in all the scenes.

The corridor walks- her eyes locked on every part of my face, while all I could do was embody what my Gen Z, Instagram-addicted son describes as his personality—yes, a sigma male, or an alpha male, whatever that means.  Sorry about the Gen Z references, but I consider myself a modern guy, even in medicine. Speaking of which, here's a joke for you: Do you know why the homoeopath brought a microscope to work? Because he couldn't see the effectiveness of her medicines!

Indeed, an alpha (or sigma) dad. But the tale goes on like this: the ignoring, the egos, the blue-tick-no-replies - it was rough, but I was convinced I was certainly right. Julie, on the other hand, moved on pretty quickly. After I had shifted to the US, I learned that she had moved on to the UK and had been accepted into the Oxford Aviation Academy to pursue her dream- flying. The one that never ghosted her.

***PLAY***

I needed clarification. I was upset. I moved my hands, one pointing at the man, the other at her. I furrowed my eyebrows, giving a questioning stare that demanded, ‘Who are you to her?’.

Nivin's eyes, once brimming with hope, now reflected a deep worry that mirrored my own unease. He extended a trembling hand toward me, his voice barely a whisper, "Doc, she's Julie. I need to know about the reports. Is everything all right?" The weight of his words hung in the air, and my inability to find a comforting response added to the palpable tension in the room.

I ran out of words. My mind spun, and my eyes revolved around the room uneasily.

Julie’s mystical eyes, the MRI reports, husband Nivin’s worried gleam, and the wall posters. 

My throat tightened as I reached for the water, the cool liquid doing little to soothe the unease settling within me. My gaze shifted to the poster on the wall, the bold letters spelling out my achievements. Yet, beneath the surface, beneath the accolades, a storm brewed within, threatening to disrupt the calm facade.

I read the report statements and the MRI images. I couldn’t draw any link between anything in the room. 

“Hi Julie, nice to see you! I want you to wait outside. Could I please talk to Nivin?”

“Oh sure, you won’t kill him, though, would you?” She laughed.

The nurse assisted her, and the room now stood silent, with the both of us exchanging heavy stares.

His eyes oozed with tears, and he smacked the table. I took a heavy breath and consoled him. 

A profound sense of self-doubt gnawed at me, and I found solace in the familiar taste of blood as I unconsciously bit my lip. It struck me as odd; after all, I attend to nearly fifty patients daily, an almost mechanical routine that supposedly grants immunity to emotions. Yet, in the quiet moments, as Julie's story unfolded, I was forced to confront the vulnerability within, an unsettling reminder that, beneath the veneer of a seasoned doctor, I was still human, susceptible to the tidal wave of emotions crashing against the walls I had built - and the walls break pretty easily for friends and family.

Something felt unusual here- someone I liked back in school, those golden dimples, the passion she showed every time we talked, her successful career - and here was a case of an early onset Alzheimer's on the same remarkable gem, barely 35 years old. 

- - -

Never did I anticipate that Julie and my path would converge once again. Seeing the scan results, the hippocampus shrinkage, the tangles visible in the brain imaging, and the plaques - this was rare - a woman barely in her 30s diagnosed with Alzheimer’s.

Julie’s boldness shone, and the fact that her career and life would be doomed within a few years didn’t seem to bother her - it was a testament to the strength of her soul.

Exhaustion washed over me like a tide. A doctor, typically the harbinger of healing, confronted the stark reality of his own vulnerability. Treating those close to you inevitably unearths the human facets we often strive to conceal. In this poignant moment, I grappled with a profound sense of failure, my emotions tightening their grip on every fibre of my being. Helplessness loomed large, casting its shadow over me. 

“Nivin, Julie won’t be the one suffering. She won’t be in pain. She won’t be the patient. Alzheimer’s is one such villain who’ll prey on the patient’s loved ones. Disturbances, pain, and all of it are things that we - you and I - have to brace ourselves for. This disease encompasses all the emotions, depending on how we see it.”

I remember spending hours explaining to him what a neurodegenerative disease does. 

First, the speech, then the memories and slowly, the motor movement.

Physical agitation and violence - all a part of it.

But the part that pierces your soul is the gradual loss of familial memories - kids, parents, husband- name them all. Witnessing the transformation of the once active, enthusiastic person quickly fades away into shattered reflections of a mere shell, devoid of emotions, speechless and rather soulless, becomes the heart-wrenching ordeal that leaves scars on the souls of every doctor.

We employed the traditional approach for the first stage- omega-3 fatty acid supplements, vitamin D, speech therapy, exercise for motor functions and hydration. However, the paradox of my profession became quite evident, knowing these are only temporary interventions and that the disease will soon crave its path, thanks to its relentless course. 

Eventually, emotional detachment became my coping mechanism, and I could feel the emotional fortitude required within me beginning to develop. Yet as my emotions muted, my commitment as a doc to every patient only grew stronger - I realised that I was the wall they leaned on. It was my duty to ensure that for each patient, each story leaving an indelible mark, I never should let faith slip from their minds.

***PAUSE***

That night, I returned to my apartment and checked the racks. Inside the briefcase where I had all my school memories and albums stored, I found it.

A crumbled piece of paper with coffee stains on the corners, but the confession poem writing was as neat as ever.

<p>“Hey Alex,<br>
My skin tingling with Alex Pox's itchy dance,<br>
Your eyes unravel my thoughts in a trance.<br>
Can't help but notice your effortless grace,<br>
Meeting up could be a captivating embrace?<br>
Share with me the secret of your godly stride,<br>
Not asking for a ring, just enjoying the ride.<br>
My eyes, like magnets, drawn to every part,<br>
That enchanting smile, a treasure from the heart.<br>
Remember our first encounter's light,<br>
You said tunnels end with a hopeful sight.<br>
Thoughts pour through my mind, a swirling funnel,<br>
You filled my heart, just an oil barrel!”</p>

I couldn’t stop laughing. She continued, 

“They say dimples are deformities,<br>
But your stubble-d cheeks, I'm not at ease.<br>
The day you asked me to drop you home quick,<br>
Guess who prayed for traffic?”<br>
I did pray, too, by the way, Julie.<br>
“And here's a pinky promise to the apple of my burning heart,<br>
Your drizzle waters the touch you planted,<br>
Won't leave you, my male-minx,<br>
Will unpack all the cool stuff in you with every convo, yours and mine,<br>
And hopefully gonna live together, ageing like fine wine…”</p>

I had no clue why her proposal was still alive in my rack,  but it effortlessly revived the untouched corners of my school memories. My eyes glistened.
