<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">I am a free bird<br>
Who wants to see the world<br>
And fly far away<br>
But all I can do<br>
Is sit here and drool<br>
That’s how I’m spending my day.</p>



<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Trapped in a cage<br>
I’m forced to gaze<br>
Into the world that’s far away<br>
But all I can do<br>
Is sit here and drool<br>
That’s how I’m spending my day.



<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">I can’t even shout<br>
To let me out<br>
Into the world that’s far away<br>
But all I can do<br>
Is sit here and drool<br>
That’s how I’m spending my day.



<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">There’s this rope<br>
That has tied my hope<br>
Of flying far away<br>
But all I can do<br>
Is sit here and drool<br>
That’s how I’m spending my day.



<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Through the bars I glimpse<br>
At a  world that hints<br>
That there’s more to the sun’s bright rays<br>
But all I can do<br>
Is sit here and drool<br>
That’s how I’m spending my day.



<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Deep in my core<br>
There’s a yearning, a roar<br>
That I won't forever stay<br>
Beyond that script<br>
Above that crypt<br>
I shall seek the sun rays I praise.
