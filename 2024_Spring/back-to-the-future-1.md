Hello there! This is Krithi, your captain for the day, here to take you on a ride with a bunch of people who are currently pretending like they‚Äôre ready for the next phase of life. Still doesn‚Äôt sound familiar? Of course, cuz we‚Äôre more popularly known as ‚Äúthe pandemic batch.‚Äù Yes, that‚Äôs right, folks, the OG lab rats are here, alive and barely surviving. Now, the weather looks particularly dull today, with the rising layoff season and barely progressing final-year projects, but I guess we‚Äôll pull through.¬†

For all the passengers, there are six emergency exits in this aircraft, none of which you can use to escape the hurdles BTech throws at you. In case of emergencies, oxygen masks will drop down from above your seat, just like your grades. In the unlikely event of an emergency landing and evacuation, leave your carry-on items behind, just like you leave your friends, family, and hope for a good package behind. Please fasten your seatbelts, and hold on tight to the thread you‚Äôre hanging on as this is going to be one hell of a ride.

### Why go back to the future?

With all that optimism out of the way, sure, stepping into a new phase of your life in the middle of a pandemic has had its ups and downs, but it was definitely quite the experience. I‚Äôve had the opportunity to meet, interact with, and make fun of so many wonderful and talented people along the way, and wanted to record some of our experiences somewhere out in this large data of IITTP just for a quick nostalgic look someday.¬†

Treading the same path as one of my favorite Udaan elders, Prabhat, with his work of art Second Chance article, this is my attempt to do something similar, to try and see how my batch has lived their college life and what they would like to change. As an add-on, this article will also serve as a customized guide to our campus and college life with some favorite spots of the ‚Äò24 batch and some items on the bucket list that, hopefully, you guys can add in too! (In case your list isn't already overflowing from stuff you haven't gotten to do since you joined college)

Okay, enough said, folks; I‚Äôll talk to you again before we reach our destination. Until then, sit back, relax, and enjoy the rest of the flight.

### The Map

>As one of the first batches to settle into a fully functional ahem transit campus and also slowly transition into the permanent blocks and buildings, there are several places that are home to plenty of memories. With the campus continuously evolving, some of these places don‚Äôt even exist now! Let‚Äôs take a look at a personally curated campus map of the batch of ‚Äò24, not one with the construction phases, but rather one where new friendships are forged, secrets are revealed, fights are resolved, and memories are made.

> *PS: I‚Äôd like to apologize for the lack of detail in these maps; pls excuse, I tried my best.*

<details>
<summary><b>1: Front gate name wall thingy</b>
</summary>

The perfect spot for that 2 am breeze and deep philosophical thoughts. When you lie down on the wall and look up at the sky, the rest of the campus just fades away, and it's just you and the stars and your thoughts ‚ú®.

<summary><b>2: The waterfall behind CRC</b>
</summary>

I sleep there occasionally. And some of my favorite memories with my best friend were made there.

\- *Shamil Niyas*

>*To all the freshies who have no idea what this is about, there is this place in front of CRC where, with good rainfall, a cute little waterfall used to flow to the bottom. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs enough water these days to be seen but it was a ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù moment for most of us who had just settled in a new campus amidst the pandemic.*¬†

<a id="balcony-outside-tc-22"></a>

<summary><b>3: Balcony outside TC-22</b>
</summary>

It is the spot for post-a.m. shenanigans and truth-or-dare sessions. When you're there on top of the whole campus, the truth has a habit of slipping right out. Perfect spot to just hang out and look at the glittering lights of the campus and even to watch the sunrise if you stay up long enough.

\- *Sathyanarayann*

This place is actually a bit peaceful. Sometimes listening to some songs, gazing through the factories and the distant lights, feeling that calm breeze alone, and thinking about absolutely nothing really gives a lot of peace.

<summary><b>4: Bus Stand Outside Old Library</b>
</summary>

One of my favorites is the bus stop outside the old library, after dinner, we all gather, gossiping about each other. We are friends of different branches, so we usually talk about every professor and then make fun of the one friend who is committed. It was fun, though, when we stayed in the old campus.¬†

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>5: Old CC Lab</b>
</summary>

The old CC lab, with its air-conditioned room and no restraint on the lab timings, was one of my favorite spots. P.S.: I believe restraints on lab timings were imposed, but it was never strictly followed, and I am grateful for that.¬†

\- *Songs_of_solemn_birds_sound_silent*

>*Ah, another thing that the freshies will never be able to experience. For some context, until the previous year, the room opposite the health center office had multiple systems with such good air conditioning and used to be open till 2 AM, thanks to student volunteers. For most of the transit students, this was the perfect study spot, a blessing in disguise until, of course, one day, we woke up, and everything was in DB2 (or AB1, gosh, this is harder than keeping up with the latest GenZ slang).*

<summary><b>6: Lab 1</b>
</summary>

One interesting story is associated with the seating space outside Lab 1. One of my friends and I decided to meet up over there to discuss my SoP for my bid to be the Internship Coordinator. We ended up talking, talking and talking. By the time we ended, the Mess had started cooking breakfast, lol. We realized it was probably too late and should head back to our rooms.

<summary><b>7: Outer Ring Road</b>
</summary>

One of my favourite campus spots, particularly during the quietude of midnight, is the ring road encircling the south campus. As the bustling activity of the day subsides and the campus drifts into slumber, this stretch of road transforms into something magical. The pitch-black skies above, unobscured by artificial light, offer a breathtaking canvas for stargazers like myself. With the hills behind the campus fading into obscurity, it's a scene straight out of a dream. It's a sanctuary where I can lose myself in the beauty of the night sky.

<details>
<summary><b>8: OAT Stairs</b>
</summary>

OAT stairs in the early morning when no one's there. Sorry extrovert peeps, I love solace. Especially in the 5th semester, when Malhar hostel students had to go to the south campus mess three times a day, and the earliest tempo was at 7 in the morning. The 10-15 minutes before the mess was open and the 10-15 minutes after the breakfast till the next bus to classes at 8 am were golden. There wasn't a sweet sun in the skies; there was a mirror, reflecting the current situation, at times my sheer frustration, but sometimes the beam of optimism that this will gradually get better (although a new type of problem keeps me frustrated now lol, but structurally Malhar hostel has definitely improved). I dearly loved that.

\- *Frustrated Mess eater*

>*That was definitely one episode of never let them know your next move.*

OAT, especially during Tirutsava and other college fests, a memory¬†

<summary><b>9: The mess</b></summary>



>*Who in the world has the mess in their list of favorite spots‚Ä¶*¬†

One story is about the mess where I had my first non-academic all-nighter when cooking Prasadam for 50 people for the festivities of Dussehra. We cooked sweet porridge in about ten batches while staying awake throughout the night. I was accompanied by two of my juniors who, after that night, became good friends. I even ended up with a cut on my finger, lol. On a side note, I cut my finger again during the Inter-IIT cult meet as well. We ended up winning a silver medal there. It looks like cuts are not bad, after all!

<summary><b>10: Lab 2 front:</b></summary>



The IT spot of the campus in our second and third years, there was ALWAYS something going on here, and it never ceased to be an unforgettable experience.¬†

<summary><b>11: Old Idea Square Room:</b></summary>



>*Finally, somebody‚Äôs talking about this!*

Ahhh, the memories in that place... That room was THE room for the college üòÇ. I used to practically live there and have seen people get up to all kinds of stuff there ‚ò†Ô∏è. There were always the serious nerds, the ones who just wanna play, the couple who wanna ' group study' and whatnot.¬†

\- *Sathyanarayann*


My First Ideathon event, Inter IIT, Eyantra discussions, and many more memorable events happened there. During my tenure as one of the heads of Idea-Square, we had a lot of discussions on what the room should look like, trying to move things here and there. With the team, we had discussions regarding budget planning, workshops, and coordinating with all for workshops. I remember having long talks with the club advisor about workshops, drafting posters, and figuring out how to get more participants for events.¬†

\- *Arunkumar*

>*There was also this tiny scholars' room of sorts with a nice fan and AC. I remember the PFC peeps getting exclusive access to it during \*ahem\* Tirutsava. During the scorching months of March and April, a quick one-minute peek into this room was enough to cool you down enough to face the sun god‚Äôs wrath again.*¬†

<summary><b>12: Flowers?</b></summary>

Transit Lab 2 has a white flower tree, which only has fragrant flowers on campus; whenever I go to the south mess or to meet someone("_"), I pick 4-5 flowers. They don't last long but still, give fragrance till the last breath, and they don't know that they are only such flowers like I take that lesson that - good to share even if you don't get any returns but for sure you won't regret when you hold back. I don't want this spot to be anonymous, so name it(Kushi ka Kushbu) or make more such places.

<details>
<summary><b>13: More Stairs</b></summary>

One of my most cherished campus spots is the staircase nestled between Hostel Block E and the Guest House. It served as my go-to study haven during the times when F Block was devoid of Wi-Fi connectivity. What made this spot truly remarkable was its ability to transport me back to the comforts of home. Surrounded by lush greenery, the presence of plants and dogs made me feel like I was at home.

<details>
<summary><b>14: The road behind the rest house and hostels</b></summary>

In the second and third years, most of my favorite spots were in the south campus, like the wall behind the rest house, where we celebrated birthdays and beat each other black and blue while smearing cake on the birthday boy. The idea^2, where I could study in peace and get used to offline exams again. The mess where I did most of my cooking in college. Or the gallery besides TC22, where I loved spending time alone.

\- *Ishaan Kulkarni*

My absolute favorite has to be the chill spot behind Hostel B. That's where we used to hang out at night, just enjoying each other's company and our awesome friendship. It's definitely the best spot, no question about it.

<details>
<summary><b>15: Scrapyard</b></summary>

Literally the hidden gem of the college. At any given moment, you could go there and find the wildest, craziest imaginable things. The memories of conducting an entire fest out of waste from the scrapyard will always standout and is one I will be telling generations of IITians xD

\- *Sathyanarayann*

>*One thing that has remained constant throughout BTech is Satya and his ever-loving attraction to the most random trash on the street.*¬†

<details>
<summary><b>16: The Neem Tree</b></summary>

>*Ah, the infamous spot, view, check, breeze check, clear night sky check, what else could you ask for?*

Had the most fun conversations and spent the best time with my friends that I made throughout this B.Tech. No matter what, whether I talk with those people at present or not, they will always be a part of my memories, and it always puts a smile on my face when I think of them‚ù§Ô∏è.

<summary><b>17: TC7, Indoor Complex</b></summary>

>*Captain‚Äôs back cuz I have my favorite spots, too! One of my first memories of campus was in TC7 when I walked in to find some of my favorite seniors jamming to some of my favorite music. Since then, I grew to love this place, hate this place, then love it again. I remember taking up the Sargam Coordinator role, constantly tracking equipment, running back and forth, and slowly hating the sound of the drums (Ahem, sorry, Habibi), the noise, the lack of peace, the walk from my room all the way to indoor and whatnot. Then I learned to slow down, make it my home, and get comfortable. I remember spending nights there with my favorite people, just trying to support each other, have fun, and get shit done. It‚Äôs, of course, not the place but the people, but that room will always hold a special place in my heart.*¬†

<summary><b>18: Lake</b></summary>

>\*\*Ahem\*\*

My favorite spot is the bench near the lake to the left of the Admin Block, where I often visit in the evenings alone because it is very peaceful watching the still water in the lake, and it calms the heart. I recommend u to try it.

<details>
<summary><b>20: DB2 Cafeteria</b></summary>

>*Now, this is definitely one of our latest favorites! What better cure for a long day of classes than a hot samosa?*

This is where I spent a lot of time chatting with my friends. A lot of random topics pop out; talks and chitchat would go on for hours. One such topic is that, with our friends, we tried creating a fake Bumble account and cracked a lot of jokes while scrolling through it. I laughed a lot that day, to the point where my stomach started hurting.¬†

\- *Arunkumar*¬†

<details>
<summary><b>21: Common Rooms</b></summary>

The common room in our G block was one of my favorite spots. All the time I spent gaming with my bros and getting into sleep while talking with one another... These single rooms cannot replace that vibe‚ú®

<details>
<summary><b>22: Water Tank</b></summary>

The water tank behind the north mess is one of my favorite spots in the night on campus. The 10-minute trek to reach the tank is in itself a spooky, adventurous experience. A bunch of us used to turn on the flashlights and watch out for snakes, while the others were keen on noticing even the slightest of sounds from the bushes. Once we reach the top of the tank, the breathtaking view of the campus would make all the risks totally worth it.¬†

The most fun experience associated with the tank was on my birthday this year. My close friend from another IIT had come over to our campus to surprise me. After all the cake-cutting, birthday bashes (the bruises were terrible), and celebrations, we headed over to the tank with a speaker and some snacks at 3 am. The fantastic view, coupled with cold winds and Ilaiyaraja songs, made it a beautiful, memorable night. We started discussing various incidents, experiences and future plans, picking up exactly from where we left when we had met the last time around. We were greeted by a glorious sunrise in the morning, reminding us that the whole night had passed by while we were still chatting. We returned back to our hostel with immense happiness and fond memories, wanting to go back again there one more time.

>*PS. Remember the dude with the biscuits in the cafeteria talking to ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù? that someone is most likely our water tank dude here, okay thanks bye*

### The Bucket List
>We then asked all these people their bucket list what they were able to fulfill in the four years of BTech, and what were the unticked boxes. Let‚Äôs take a look at some stats now. Sorry for the responses I‚Äôve not represented here this is just for an all in one bucket list, and some honourable mentions of course.*¬†

<a id="living-the-same-dream"></a>
**Living the same dream**

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/vlnE20qEDjM-nu2GDlu8Io5jil8Hvh9oodDwlDBJ3ynM2_adCFICxWg0reEQc3MRbKSf5JLvaswKfF9NsDPZPoarQIZ0W5HXd2S52XuK7trYUXmXi4xtl5ZwpO8dl4qVs9QBUeXkTsbwsxDMo0EfiAQ)

Formed a secret society that explored hidden tunnels and rooftops after hours. Our motto: ‚ÄúWhere the moonlight leads, we follow.‚Äù

\- *J Sai Charan*

Travelling for competition has always been on my bucket list, and I got the chance to check it off with SIH‚Äô23. Ah, our time at the Smart India Hackathon in Udaipur was a wild ride, full of unforgettable moments that extended far beyond the competition. We endured a grueling 24-hour train journey that left us drained. And guess what? The nodal center for SIH had their own college volunteers slaving away for a whopping two days straight, round the clock. They were practically more zombies than us!¬†

Picture this: showers with curtains so see-through, you might as well have been outdoors, and washrooms that seemed to have forgotten the meaning of water (seems like those Rajasthan stereotypes aren't entirely off the mark). While every other team had their mentors with them, we were the lone rangers, looking like the competition's forgotten children. And oh, don't get me started on the rule about having at least three team members awake at night! All of us snoozed away, forcing the organizing committee to shake our team leader awake and issue a 3 a.m. warning. I mean, we're from IITT, we're entitled to our beauty sleep, even if there's a competition going on! When we won, everyone was left dumbfounded, wondering how on earth this reckless bunch managed to pull it off. But yeah, that's just the way the cookie crumbles.¬†

Then there's the hilarious saga of one of our buddies who managed to charm someone within just two days, only to have to say goodbye all too soon. And let's not overlook our stroke of genius: playing Subway Surfers while dodging paans at the station. Despite the chilly weather, the locals were as warm as ever, and the food was simply unbeatable. Teasing friends added some warmth to the cold. When all's said and done, it's a memory we'll treasure forever.

\- *The Udaipur Odyssey*

**Some honourable mentions**¬†

* Lying on the road looking at stars
* Try this if you haven‚Äôt already, must recommend¬†
* Write a journal-worthy publication work
* Quite literally a honorable mention
* Sleep for more than half a day

>*Again, quite literally a honorable mention*

* Late Night Maggi

>*Does anybody know when the night canteen will open again? Nevermind*

* Sit in other branches' classes
* Ride a Scooty on campus
* We go Gym
* Constant Life goals
* Falling in love, breakup

>*Both were written by the same person :‚Äô*

* Dancing with friends, Pranks on Friends
* DJ Nights, oof, always a memory
* Meeting a stag

>*A wholesome fateful encounter.*¬†       

  As a devoted Potterhead, particularly enchanted by the Marauders era, I've always held a fascination for stags. Naturally, meeting one up close became a personal goal, and the most accessible opportunity for this was at IITM. The encounter was nothing short of surreal. Picture this: I was savouring a quiet moment with my coffee in the caf√© near the hostel block when suddenly, a majestic stag came and sat next to me. This will be etched in my memory forever.

**Items Unchecked**

* Interact and make friends
* Spend four years in college
* Freshers Day
* Sports from First Year
* Intra/ Inter IITs

>*See kids? The effect of a corona batch is real: No Freshers Day, forced to introduce each other on gmeet, no Tirutsava (twice, and one online and one‚Ä¶ I deny all allegations), Inter IIT, and even NSO is in the very last semester.

.*That was well, I think you can guess. Moving forward*

1. Go on a cool trip with friends. 
2. Have a bonfire and an all-nighter fun session. 
3. Run at full speed all the way along the residential quarter road with hands swaying wildly. (just like Phoebe would do).¬†             

\- *dotdot&dot*

>*Anybody who makes friends references definitely deserves a cool trip!*

I have never engaged in a fight, and I've never wanted to engage üòÇ. But I wanted to be the judge for resolving a conflict (rather than actually resolving it), which seemed more interesting to me because I know the context of most of the fights that have happened on our campus through gossip.

### The Second Chance

>Now, with bucket lists exposed, let‚Äôs move on to the final stage of existential crisis, the What Ifs. Now I asked all these people what they would change if they had another shot at BTech, another chance to go through college with all they know now. We have some ‚Äúhurts right here in my meow meow‚Äù responses, and I leave it to you, dear passengers, to travel at your own risk. Jk, you have no choice, just check if your seatbelts are still on.

Oh, I'd definitely have done some things differently. I wasn't interested much in the very department I chose at the start, Chemical Engineering, and joined here after a last-minute thought, but over time I'm facing interesting and challenging things in this subject that are fuelling my curiosity. If I'd got another chance, I'd planned things beforehand to free myself some time for learning Telugu, which I decided to do for four straight years, but never did :)

Lastly, I'd interact with people a lot more (given going back in time doesn't mean dreadful CoVID comes back again) in person, which I feel is important to be ASAP to plan bigger and sustainable events in the future.

> *\- Frustrated Mess eater*

>*Of course, there‚Äôs always the confused state of what you like and what you don‚Äôt. Frustrated Mess eater, I hope you find many more opportunities to explore and learn about the things you like!*

- - -

I believe that one should not regret the choices one made; either take those consequences or make new consequences.

This was struck the first time in 4th sem when I always hated my past year, but once I realized those cannot be undone, we can only move forward from now. Then I started to question every moment, "Will I regret this?" if I got the answer "no," I proceeded.

Leave all these as for now My-Redo-BTech things:

1. Wake up at 7 and do exercise (lol).
2. Make class notes.
3. Study good (lol).
4. I started friendships with guys, then girls, and I will change this.
5. Play every sport.

\- *The anonymous romantic*

I would have tried my best to stay away from getting close to any of the girls. Could have led a better life actually doing that. That's it.

>*Who hurt you guys:‚Äô On Another note, some of those sound like the New Year resolutions I took knowing they would die within a week.*¬†

If you look at it, there are infinite ways this could have gone down. But it has gone down a certain way. And I don't have any complaints about it as such. So, I think what I did was the best way forward for me.<joke> On a lighter note, I would have chosen IIT Bombay and stayed closer to home. Would have dug metal ores out of the ground for a living after that </joke>

\- Ishaan Kulkarni

I would sleep better. I think I have not been getting enough sleep. Other than that, my BTech life was pretty chill. I didn't bother about grades, just wanted to not get a backlog, and I have managed that well. So that's good enough.¬†

I wanted to be more involved in cultural. And I guess I did kinda manage that as well. We conducted a Tirutsava and we had a pretty good cultural year as well. So that's all good as well. Still think I could have had more stuff going on. Probably if I go back, I will be a little more involved in cultural.

Pretty much that. I ain't got no regrets. I would have loved to have a proper friend gang, but that's alright; I am more of a free loner anyway.¬†

\- *Shamil Niyas*

>*This dude has been up and about talking to people since day one. Of course, there is prominent discrimination in this campus, and this guy has ignored it all to become a secretary, and personally joke around with people from the most diverse backgrounds. Of course, his tenure had its own ups and downs, but he brings the energy to every party, and at least that‚Äôs enough to get things started.*¬†

1. Build better rapport with classmates and professors right from the first day. 
2. Be in all clubs, no matter the quantity of quality work you do. 
3. Taking up more multi-disciplinary stuff.

\- *dotdot&dot*

>*All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy*

Firstly I wouldn't join IIT Tirupati. I wouldn't have taken mechanical engineering. I would've gone to a top college in Bangalore for CSE or got for VIT so that I could have some all-round development, experience college culture, explore extracurriculars well and have more fun rather than joining this shitty college where I was deprived of these.

\- *The Finance Manager*

If I had a chance to redo my B. Tech, I would have opted for another IIT (I believe the question is set up, and I am seeking this answer). In the case, I am constrained to pursue my B. Tech at IITT, I would not change a lot. I am grateful that I got to study the discipline of my preference. Having said that, I probably would back myself a bit more, get involved in some club activities, say a few jokes out loud, work on a few interdisciplinary projects, interact more with the faculties, and be more decisive about my future.

\- *Songs_of_solemn_birds_sound_silent*

>*Well, the college sure has its ups and downs, being a newly established third-generation IIT. But on the plus side, as a student, you get to start cultures, clubs, ideas, events, and whatnot! It‚Äôs like writing your name on the moon so every other person who visits will see that you‚Äôve made a mark. Openly getting access to clubs, and facilities, organizing events, and being a part of a directly influencing committee for big events like Tirutsava are all experiences that you usually don‚Äôt get in more established colleges. You also openly have a say in the development of this college and get to make several changes (like the girls' hostel curfew) that are stepping stones for years to come! All in all, it might have its downfalls, but it‚Äôs definitely an experience!*

If I could do Btech again, I wouldn't. But if I were forced to, I probably would have studied a bit more in my second and third years coz gpa ‚ò†Ô∏è. Apart from that, would've probably tried to learn some marketable skills and marketed it earlier on some side hustles to enjoy a more comfortable college experience. Probably would've also made some changes in choices in college politics, but not sure how much of a difference it would've made ü§∑üèΩ

I'd involve myself more in cultural and literary activities like quizzing, debating, and skits. I would love to work on more research projects and get tangible outputs in the form of publications. Most importantly, I would be more cautious not to fall for pranks by my friends through fake confessions xD.

I would try to be an extrovert from the start. I would have tried learning some new musical instruments. I would have attended a lot of debates and oratory events. I would try to enhance my communication and interpersonal skills. I would have started hitting the gym way earlier. My friend's circle was initially very small. If I had tried interacting with a lot of friends at the start, I would have known them better. I would have planned a lot more trips, and I for sure wouldn't have missed any musical concerts or events.¬†

>*Here comes the one behind the hope given to the previous victim. But seriously, communication and other soft skills play an equally important role in anything you plan to do after college. The debate club conducts several events and competitions; make sure to pop in whenever you‚Äôre free, even for an hour or two, and just talk it out! It‚Äôs okay if you get stuck; we all started with very shaky half-minute speeches but learned so much along the way from the community!*

I‚Äôd focus more on building lasting friendships and less on cramming for exams.

Academic Explorer: Would take more elective courses outside my major to broaden my knowledge.

Networking Guru: Would attend more seminars and workshops to connect with professionals in my field.

Community Contributor: This would start a sustainability initiative to make the campus greener.

The Digital Uprising: I‚Äôd lead the charge for seamless IT services. Wi-Fi signals would be as strong as our academic resolve and mobile data as fast as our sprint to morning classes. (Well, I used two wrong examples üòâ). These are the changes I‚Äôd fight for, ensuring our B.Tech journey is not just about degrees but about quality experiences that fuel both mind and body. üéìüí™

Would I opt for a different route if given the chance? Perhaps.

Reflecting on the possibilities, there are moments where I can't help but wonder, "What if?" What if I had invested time in learning a musical instrument or continued with my BTP? Should I have chosen a different elective? Maybe I shouldn't have indulged in binge-watching ten seasons of Grey's Anatomy. Could things have unfolded differently? Maybe.

But here's the kicker‚ÄîI don't regret where I am right now. Nope, not one bit. 'Cause every quirky detour, every wrong turn, and every bizarre decision I've made has led me to this very moment. And guess what? I kinda like the person I've become along the way. So, would I rewrite history if given the chance? Nah, I'll stick to my weird and wonderful journey, thank you very much. After all, it's the mishaps and misadventures that make life truly awesome.

Nothing much; I am happy with whatever I did‚Ä¶

>Authors note now? Well, if you ask me, I would not have wasted my holidays binging random TV shows in guilt and rather have done something productive. Ah, but all‚Äôs well that ends, kinda, well. To all of you guys, college is fun, you can make it fun (after barely surviving) It‚Äôs fine if you don‚Äôt have an in-house Domino‚Äôs or a good restaurant in a 5km radius (It‚Äôs not really fine, but let‚Äôs pretend it is).

>Just one thing, at the end of your four years, make sure you have something to look back to, something to take with you, and something to leave behind. For BTech students, you have 8 beautiful semesters with so many events and competitions, and college is like an empty page waiting for you to draw a self-portrait. It‚Äôs okay if you‚Äôre bad at drawing; you can just call it abstract art and make millions out of it.

Well, that‚Äôs it, ladies and gentlemen; we‚Äôve successfully landed. You may now take off your seat belt, give us a good farewell, and proceed to your connecting flights to embark on your journey. We hope this has been a pleasant ride and that you leave with nothing short of an unforgettable experience. This is your captain, signing off!
