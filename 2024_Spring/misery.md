<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">When life is blooming, like a flower in spring;<br>
When things go as planned, no troubles they bring;<br>
When nothing bothers you, and your mind is calm;<br>
When all your lifeâ€™s control seems to reside in your palm,</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Then, indeed, you might feel that life is all easy;<br>
Perhaps you might feel life is pleasant and breezy,<br>
But have you ever thought, in fact,<br>
Whether the mind must forever remain intact?<br>
Watch the mind grow, watch its beauty unfold,<br>
Simultaneously difficult it is to uphold<br>
The mental state that all aspire to possess,<br>
The perfection all crave, the longing for finesse,<br>
Throw the mind forever in repetitive stress,<br>
Then you know that your mind is a mess.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Continuously pushing against that large barrier<br>
Is your overloaded mind that is now a carrier<br>
Of all the rubbish you have forced into it,<br>
Making it really hard to keep itself fit.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">So, learn the art of mastering your mind,<br>
Only after that, true peace you shall find;<br>
Shed all your cravings and slip into the void:<br>
Of all the miseries, you shall find yourself devoid.</p>
