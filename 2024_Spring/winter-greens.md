<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">With the dawn of wintery chills<br>
Emerges the repertoire of memories<br>
With the cold air and burning breeze<br>
Drifts the steam of freshly boiled milk and tea.</p>



<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">While misty fog surrounds the earth<br>
taunts about wearing proper clothes fill my ears.<br>
Fuzzy warm blankets<br>
And a sun that matches none<br>
With the comforting rays of hope<br>
And the radiance of my mum, </p>



<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Come the gestures from my dad<br>
To iron my clothes, keeping them warm<br>
And finding the wooliest scarves to keep me calm.<br>
Soupy nights and buttery mornings<br>
Satiate my childhood yearnings.</p>



<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Winter is a constant reminder,<br>
Of the warmth that emanates from my homes rear,<br>
It is a teary memory, a soothing thought<br>
That I long for now.</p>
