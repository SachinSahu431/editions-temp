<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">There is a bench at the local park, under the shade of trees<br>
Where the couples rest, under the dark, with a cold breeze<br>
Some words spoken, some left unsaid<br>
But still visible on their faces, their feelings, expressed<br></p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">There is a bench at the dilapidated factory, overrun by weeds and creepers<br>
Where the little children, who are free, curse<br>
And laugh and play and sing with each other<br>
Making memories with their friends, who they think of as a brother<br></p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">There is a bench at the middle of the main market<br>
Where some kids are buying toys, some men are serving sweets, and some are selling carpet<br>
A family is seen resting, planning to go shopping and dining, specifically in this order<br>
One of the rare times, all of them are, at the same place, together<br></p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">There is a bench at the beach, graced by the view of an endless sea<br>
With biscuit in hand a woman sits, sipping her coffee or tea<br>
Thinking what's in store for her future<br>
Maybe a loving family, and a great career<br></p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">What is our place in society? What is our purpose?<br>
Philosophers have come and gone, stamping their opinion, mostly verbose sometimes terse<br>
But always unable, to convince with utmost surety<br>
With their elaborate theories: interesting, but with idealistic purity<br></p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">What we do know is that there are connections<br>
Interlinked among humans across all sections<br>
Bonds, as we call it, which provide meaning to our existence<br>
I feel I'll be alright, with some persistence<br>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">If there is someone beside me, If there is a goal I need to quench<br>
If for each bond I need, I could find a bench<br></p>
