Just like internet slang and reel songs go viral, the term 'Depression' in itself has become a buzzword in our culture nowadays. It is thrown around in casual conversations and self-diagnosed as if it is just another emotion. Popular culture frequently romanticizes and glorifies it, spreading false notions about what it's like to live with this condition. Think about your favorite songs, television shows, and literature. Something just seems to hit more when the song goes, “I tried so hard, and got so far, in the end, it doesn't even matter.”

With this mindset now rooted, we, the internet, set out to publish our own takes on depression and other mental health disorders. As a viewer going through a tough time, I scroll through reels and come across one that says, “I used to be depressed, and drinking a [glass of turmeric lemonade](https://www.onlymyhealth.com/turmeric-lemonade-recipe-and-health-benefits-1618496512) every day is what got me here” <insert happy pictures>. I aggressively start making myself a lemonade every day. 

Was the source reliable? 

I don't care.

I hold out a hope that if they are now happy from that glass, why can't I be? 

Now comes the question of “They’re just raising awareness, why shouldn't they?” 

Well, here’s a thought; One, people who seem to be stuck cannot find reliable information in the depths of different lemonades and energy drinks on the internet. Two, people tend to develop a wrong notion of what exactly the term is and misdiagnose themselves. Maybe I am a little sad due to an emotional trigger, tiredness, or any other possible reason. I see posts like '5 signs you are in depression', and I immediately start ticking boxes and diagnosing myself. 

This toxic train of thought of “How will I know?” and “What do I trust?” leaves depression as a term in a very misunderstood place.  To clear up some of these questions, I talked to a few students pursuing psychology to understand and compile their views.

### Defining the Undefinable

Given that any mental health issue is usually subjective and manifests itself in different forms, let’s try and set some ground definitions. In clinical terms, depression is a mood disorder. It's a negative affective state when there's an extreme feeling of sadness or despair, or pessimism, and it interferes with daily activities resulting in physiological, emotional, and cognitive changes. In significant cases, a major depressive disorder is characterized by a feeling of unexplainable sadness for over a period of 2 weeks. Depressive episodes can occur in different intervals and can sometimes affect day-to-day activities. Since this is mainly 'in one’s mind,' people are often left confused as to why they don't feel like getting out of bed even after resting well or why they don't feel like eating even if it’s their usual time to eat. This can occur at any time in a person’s life and has different methods of treatment based on the source. Whatever the case, it is definitely not something one can simply 'snap' out of.

There are various misconceptions associated with depression. One such misconception evolves from the human mindset of relying on tablets and medicines to solve problems. Long periods of depression can often result in a chemical imbalance in the brain, like inhibiting the ability to secrete dopamine. Given this logic, the treatment of popping a pill when you’re sick is now applied to depression. 

But this is not the solution.

Can you completely stop thinking about a movie immediately after a tragic ending? No. But if you revisit it, you no longer get as mentally disturbed as you used to before. Similarly, it is important to read the chapter that triggers your episodes, so you can develop the courage to fight back. Along with the prescribed necessity of antidepressants, therapy helps you talk through your issues and find a possible way to accept and overcome what keeps you up. 

Another common misconception is generalizing depression into a fixed set of symptoms. It is not the same for everyone; the symptoms, the intensity, and the stressors vary. It is often believed that keeping yourself busy can help you forget about whatever is bothering you. This is far from true, as you’re constantly stuck in a position where you’re trying to do something that you don’t really feel like doing. Instead, taking some time out for self-care and spending time with family and friends might help you manage your emotions better.

### Common Signs and Symptoms

Note: These signs and symptoms are just patterns observed in different people diagnosed with depression. Any of these issues can have other underlying causes. Any other points that might not be on this list can also contribute to depression. These factors are only intended to be an indication to approach a psychologist and discuss your symptoms. 

There are many tests and scales like [BDI](https://www.apa.org/pi/about/publications/caregivers/practice-settings/assessment/tools/beck-depression)  [[CDI and CDRS](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16231477/) for children]  to measure behavioral manifestations and severity of depression. Some common assessment scales while observing patients for at least a period of 2 weeks include:

* Loss of interest/pleasure in activities that were once enjoyable
* Changes in appetite: Weight loss/ gain
* Changes in sleeping patterns: Excessive sleeping or trouble sleeping
* Loss of energy/increased fatigue
* Difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making decisions
* Feeling worthless, guilty, or hopeless
* Thoughts of death or suicide

While it does not necessarily have to have a cause, there are a few biological and environmental factors that might contribute to depression. It can be an effect of genetics (Yes, depression can be genetic, to all those who believe it's just in the 'head'). For women, giving birth, pregnancies, and menstrual cycles can also lead to depression. Social factors for depression include traumatic experiences, social encounters like ragging and peer pressure, societal pressure, substance abuse, and poor sleep patterns. 

As such issues go untreated, they manifest as risk factors for developing depression. The lack of expressive outlets to resolve emotions, academic pressure, constant negative reinforcement causing grief, helplessness, side effects of anxiety, and major life events can all lead to an increased chance of depression.

### The Price of Popularity

While social media is truly instrumental in raising awareness, it quickly turns into a box of misleading information. With issues leading to mental health, the treatments suggested online can often lead to a placebo effect where you tend to believe what you see, and actually end up feeling better. One of the students we approached had a very interesting view on the effect of Social Media. 

“The feel-good hormone, which social media releases, can be addictive for many of us. Without a doubt, social media has a lot to offer, but it also unavoidably has negative impacts. These include a significant amount of fear, self-loathing, isolation, and the establishment of unattainable expectations. It, in my opinion, encourages a skewed sense of validation. It glorifies mental health and depression but also trivializes it at the same time.”

There are some common trends that are usually observed in how depression is portrayed on social media. One such representation is of depressed people crying in the corner at all times of the day. As rightly put out by one of the students we talked to,

“People with depression are not necessarily ALWAYS sad. They can experience momentary pleasures too. Often people with depression are shown as nihilistic. This is not true; people with depression don't necessarily think everything is pointless. In fact, they tend to be more accurate about self-analysis tests and judgments. They don't have to be cynical and villainous. People with depression can be nice and sweet, too. It doesn't necessarily have to be as dramatized as shows make it out to be - it doesn't mean mascara running down your cheeks.”

There is also the controversy of awareness and discouragement. There are various posts on mental health disorders which are followed by comments that make fun of people who are going through such issues. Content in the name of 'jokes' is often created, minimizing the struggle and glorifying the concept of mental illness.

So what exactly can be trusted? The answer seems to lead us right where the question came from. The internet does have its fair share of well-researched information available, it simply requires effort to dig through the filters of opinions. Rely on official websites, on research papers, fact-check any information that you come across, and look for citations. You can also approach mental health practitioners and verify your concerns.

### One step forward

If you’re going through a rough patch, how do you help yourself? 

Small steps matter. 

Remember not to compare yourself with others’ progress and validate how you feel so you can effectively overcome it. Even getting out of bed can be your achievement for the day. One standard and effective approach is therapy. Do not hesitate to get help, and talk about what you’re feeling to a counselor who is trained to help you through your issues. After all, '[With Help Comes Hope](https://udaaniitt.web.app/editions/2023_Winter/chapter-zero-with-help-comes-hope/).' 

Apart from this, some general habits might help you take care of your health while dealing with depression. Develop new hobbies and activities to form expressive outlets that can help you manage your emotions. Make sure not to sacrifice your food intake or your sleep patterns. It is also often useful to practice mindfulness and meditation and surround yourself with positivity. 

If someone around you shows any signs of depression, make sure to be patient with them. Encourage them to seek help, and offer positive sources of reinforcement at all times. Try not to advise or provide them with your own personal experiences. Sometimes, a simple listening ear can help them feel better. Research different symptoms and stay alert for warning signs of suicide or self-harm. Just being there for them can significantly impact their healing process.
