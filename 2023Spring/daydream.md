abio: "Iftekhar Ahmed: If you ask a friend of Iftekar’s to describe him, the first word that
  will helplessly tumble out of their mouth is ‘poet’. The soft-spoken poet, who
  radiates positive vibes and wields excellent oratory skills, Iftekhar, is
  currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering at IIT
  Tirupati. He is also a well-known badminton player who spends his spare time
  immersed in books and movies. "

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">On the other side of the glass window,<br>
While the gusty winds blew,<br>
A young lady sits among its billow,<br>
Her hair flutters with the winds’ flow.<br>
</p>


<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Her serene face, in my turbulent eyes,<br>
As if she is devoid of any earthly ties,<br>
Every dawn, I won’t need a sunrise,<br>
Her face is sufficient to dazzle my eyes.<br></p>


<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Her eyes, an iridescent sea,<br>
The moment I entered this realm of glee,<br>
Deeper I dived, brilliance grew every stee,<br>
A divine elixir of heartache for me.<br></p>


<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">With such an ethereal beauty within sight,<br>
Why look for reasons to stay and fight,<br>
With a person with a soul so bright,<br>
Why search for a cure for heart blight!<br>
</p>
